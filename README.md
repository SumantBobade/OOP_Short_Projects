# ðŸ§  OOPS Project Hub

This repository hosts a collection of **C++ projects** focused on teaching and learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) conceptsâ€”from small exercises to larger system designs.

## ðŸ”§ Projects Included

| Project Name                     | Description                                            |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **ProjectÂ 1: Processing Shopping List**   | Console app for parsing and tallying shopping items |
| **ProjectÂ 2: Matrix Transpose**           | Implement matrix classes and transpose operations   |
| **ProjectÂ 3: Bank Management System**     | Manage customer accounts, transactions, and reports |
| **ProjectÂ 4: Inventory Management System**| Track products, quantities, file persistence in CSV  |

## âœ¨ Features

- Learn and practice **core OOP concepts**: classes, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism  
- Implement real-world behaviors: file I/O, CRUD operations, data validation  
- Build C++ console-based applications endâ€‘toâ€‘endâ€”from design to persistence  

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g. `g++`, Clang) and build tools (optional: CMake or Makefile)  
- Linux, macOS, or Windows terminal/command line environment  

### Installation & Running a Project

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OOPS-Project-Hub.git
    cd OOPS-Project-Hub
    ```

2. Navigate to a project folder (e.g. `InventoryManagement`) and compile:

    ```bash
    cd InventoryManagement
    g++ -std=c++17 *.cpp -o inventory_app
    ```

3. Run the compiled application:

    ```bash
    ./inventory_app
    ```

### Predictable Behavior & Testing

- Follow on-screen menu prompts
- Test edge cases: invalid input, missing files, duplicate entries
- Ensure graceful handling of file operations and errors
